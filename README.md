BotShell is a pluggable telegram bot based on [telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon).

- speed & fast.
- pluggable plugins (no need to restart).

## Installation

BotShell requires [Python3.6+](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) to run.

First thing first install the dependencies.

```sh
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3.6
$ sudo apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/micodev/botShell.git
$ cd botShell
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt  # or use  pip depends on your vm.
```

Second thing to do is edit ```Config.json``` file.

```json
    {
        "api_hash": "Your_api_hash_here",
        "api_id":  Your_api_id,
        "bot_id": 0,
        "sudo_members": [
            your_id_or_any_sudo 
        ]
